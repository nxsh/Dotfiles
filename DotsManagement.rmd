## Notes

* Dotfiles are stored in `$HOME` which is typically `~/` or `'/home/ryan/`
* Documentation idea: three repos (dotfiles, config files (themes, , plugins etc)), and documentation files?



# Using `git` to manage dotfiles 

To quote [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles):

>The technique consists in storing a Git bare repository in a "side" folder (like $HOME/.cfg or $HOME/.myconfig) using a specially crafted alias so that commands are run against that repository and not the usual .git local folder, which would interfere with any other Git repositories around.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
git init --bare $HOME/.cfg
alias config='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.cfg/ --work-tree=$HOME'
config config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no
echo "alias config='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.cfg/ --work-tree=$HOME'" >> $HOME/.bashrc 
```

* To add our dotfiles to this repo we use `config` instead of `git` 
    + E.g. `config add .vimrc`
* We can even use this method with `symlinks` if desired, as we can clone the repo and use it's content as symlinks
