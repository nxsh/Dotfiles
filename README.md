### My Dotifiles
* This repo contains the 'dot' (`.xyz`) files I use to customise my linux installation, as well as install notes for packages

### Dotfiles To Do

## i3/i3blocks
- edit i3blocks scripts to make them more interesting
  - change the battery scripts so that the percentage changes color when charge is low, medium, or high  
  - create volume notification script, maybe use `dunst`

## Global Linux
- terminal calendar with google support, `gcalcli`, `khan` or `calcurse` are options
- update documentation
